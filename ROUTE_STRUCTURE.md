# Route Structure Summary

## Overview
The application has been restructured to separate prediction and history management into dedicated route modules for better organization and maintainability.

## New Route Structure

### 1. Prediction Routes (`/predict`)
**File:** `routes/enhanced_predict_route.py`
- `POST /predict/` - Analyze text for misinformation
- Maintains the `analysis_history` list that other routes import

### 2. History Routes (`/history`)
**File:** `routes/history_routes.py`
- `GET /history/` - Get paginated analysis history
- `GET /history/{analysis_id}` - Get specific analysis by ID  
- `GET /history/stats/summary` - Get statistics about analyses
- `PUT /history/{analysis_id}/feedback` - Update user feedback
- `DELETE /history/{analysis_id}` - Delete specific analysis
- `DELETE /history/` - Clear all history
- `GET /history/search/{query}` - Search history by text content (NEW)

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Updates
1. **Created `history_routes.py`:**
   - Extracted all history-related endpoints from `enhanced_predict_route.py`
   - Added improved error handling and logging
   - Added new search functionality
   - Better documentation and response formats

2. **Updated `enhanced_predict_route.py`:**
   - Removed history endpoints (moved to `history_routes.py`)
   - Kept core prediction functionality and shared `analysis_history` storage
   - Cleaner, more focused code

3. **Updated `main.py`:**
   - Added import for `history_routes`
   - Included history router alongside prediction router

### Frontend Updates
4. **Updated `AnalysisHistory.js`:**
   - Changed all API endpoints from `/predict/history/*` to `/history/*`
   - Updated statistics endpoint to `/history/stats/summary`
   - All functionality preserved with new route structure

## Benefits of New Structure

✅ **Better Organization:** Clear separation of concerns
✅ **Improved Maintainability:** Easier to modify and debug individual features  
✅ **Enhanced Scalability:** Easy to add new history features without affecting prediction logic
✅ **Better Documentation:** Each route module has focused, clear documentation
✅ **Future-Ready:** Structure supports easy addition of user management, analytics, etc.

## API Endpoints Summary

### Prediction
- `POST /predict/` - Main misinformation detection

### History Management  
- `GET /history/` - List analyses (paginated)
- `GET /history/{id}` - Get specific analysis
- `GET /history/stats/summary` - Get summary statistics
- `GET /history/search/{query}` - Search analyses (NEW)
- `PUT /history/{id}/feedback` - Update feedback
- `DELETE /history/{id}` - Delete analysis
- `DELETE /history/` - Clear all history

## Testing the Changes

1. Start the server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to see the new API documentation
3. Test the frontend history page to ensure all functionality works
4. Check that predictions still save to history correctly

The route separation is now complete and ready for production use!
